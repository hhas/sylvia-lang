//
//  TO DO: this is extension on List, so will need to be builtin
//


// TO DO: how best to define bridging glue for native attributes? (for now we just use handcoded `switch` blocks in `get()`; eventually the get method should presumably be in code-generated extension)

//
// attribute types: primitive(?), to-one relationship, to-many relationship; Q. how/when should these be resolved for native values? e.g. , `show (items 1 thru 5 of my_list)` [shows 5-item list], `foo: items 1 thru 5 of my_list` [expr should eval to 5-item list], `foo: reference_to items 1 thru 5 of my_list` [expr will evaluate to reference value], `delete (items 1 thru 5 of my_list)` [`delete` handler will receive specifier as argument]
//


// Q. `count(value)` vs `length of value`?
// `count(value, each: word)` vs `count(words of value)` vs `length of words of value`

// Q. what should be attribute vs what should be command? e.g. use `text 1 thru 5 of value`, not `substr(value, 1, 5)`

// words of value
// characters of value
// text of value
// text [at] 1 thru 5 of value

// note that text values should *not* have `item` elements; i.e. passing a text value where a list of text is expected will treat it as a list containing a single text item, not a list of characters; to iterate over text's characters be explicit, e.g. "map(characters of some_text,EXPR)"


// Q. at what point should chunk expressions resolve? (unlike AS, there's no implicit `get`, so presumably will resolve immediately according to type of object to which they're applied: native object -> native object; remote reference -> remote reference)

// Q. how to implement chunk exprs over native values (e.g. `items of my_list where CONDITION`)? (note that same implementation might eventually provide underpinnings for a new IPC handling framework)


// re. global namespace, supporting `A.B` as synonym of `B of A` allows reverse domain names to be used idiomatically as module names+mount points, e.g. `use com.example.foo`, `use mylib of org.example.repo` [where `use` is analogous to C `include` or Swift `import`]

// Q. how best to resolve name collisions when importing multiple modules? one option might be to block all direct referrals to that name when evaluating from source, requiring user always to qualify to avoid any ambiguity/race; in the case of baked scripts, each library's handler names would be included in the script, allowing the script to run against newer versions of the same libraries ignoring any new names that have since been added to those libraries (i.e. versioning libraries' interfaces is more significant than versioning their implementations; doubly so for libraries that define operators)


// TO DO: think it's important that symbols have their own syntax, to eliminate confusion between symbols and specifiers, e.g. in AS, `document` = class name, but `document 1` = specifier; syntax options are limited, `#NAME`, `~NAME`, ``NAME`; don't want to use `:NAME` as colon is already used as pair operator


// TO DO: how to generalize selections as queries, and when to resolve automatically (e.g. via coercion when consumed) vs explicitly (via `get` command); bear in mind that these need to support set, add, remove, etc; also mind that query resolvers may also provide foundation code for an IPC server framework
