// TO DO: leaning towards renaming 'reference' to 'query' throughout

// Q. how best to separate query construction from query resolution? (and to what extent should the former use currently available knowledge of target object to reject obviously invalid reference forms - e.g. `item named X of LIST`, `item at N of RECORD`, `items of BOOLEAN` - and what should it defer until a command is applied [which is always the case with aelib queries as AETE/SDEF resources are insufficiently complete or correct to make that determination in advance of sending the query to the target app])


// TO DO: there's a lot of bouncing about here; wouldn't be so bad if 'All*ItemsSpecifier' was standard implementation that works for any element on any selectable value; also wouldn't hurt if it could all be done as code-generated extensions; really need a 'standard language' for describing value interfaces in terms of attributes and one-to-one and one-to-many relationships (just as we already have a 'standard language' for describing handler interfaces)
