// while `at`, `named`, etc are currently defined as 'global' handlers in stdlib, they should really be defined solely as methods upon Values; e.g. in a 'tell TARGET {â€¦}' block, the target Value is used as the block's scope, so is passed as commandEnv to handlers called within it while also providing first lookup (if first lookup fails, it should fall thru to second lookup in 'tell' block's own commandEnv scope; we'll need a new Scope subclass that supports this delegation)

// TO DO: how hard to use Closure around existing `at`, `named`, etc handlers (this will pass the target object via handlerEnv: parameter) (note: each 'global' handler is an instance of stock PrimitiveHandler class parameterized with interface and Swift function, so wrapping that in Closure isn't going to cost much more than rolling bespoke classes as below)

// TO DO: closure-like equivalent to indexSelector() in reference_handlers.swift, and their corresponding PrimitiveHandler glue classes

// TO DO:


typealias InstanceMethod = MethodBase & HandlerProtocol



class MethodBase: Value {
    
    let parent: Scope // TO DO: should be AttributedValue, but for now need to kludge it to keep Handler.function_*s happy
    
    init(for parent: AttributedValue) { // the value upon which the method is called
        self.parent = ScopeShim(parent) // kludge
    }
}



// TO DO: should parent be passed to Swift func as distinct argument? (need to give more thought to command vs handler scopes, and how `tell` blocks interact with this)
