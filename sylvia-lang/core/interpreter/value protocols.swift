// record keys

// TO DO: define HashableValue as abstract subclass of Value and make Text and Tag concrete subclasses of that? (as usual, Swift's inability to declare methods 'abstract' makes that messier than it ought to be [lots of `fatalError("Subclass needs to override #function")` crap], but it'll be easier to follow than this)

// this is a bit convoluted, but ensures Record's internal Dictionary storage only allows hashable Values (Text and/or Tag) as keys, providing better type safety than using AnyHashable directly (which would allow Swift Strings, Ints, etc to sneak in as well) (in an ideal world we'd just say `typealias HashableValue = Value & Hashable`, but swiftc type checker doesn't allow that as any fule kno)

[probably because we don't want to implement `==` directly on Values, nor recalculate keys on every use; TO DO: how can this decoupling facilitate records custom-normalizing hash keys, e.g. for case-sensitive vs case-insensitive storage])
