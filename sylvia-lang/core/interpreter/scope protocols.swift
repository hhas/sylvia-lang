// Attributed Values, Environment


//


// TO DO: pass entire identifier/command to attributed value, env, etc for combined lookup + evaluation operation; this should simplify calling, avoid need for `get` to return scope, and allow alternate env implementations to process commands differently, e.g. an ObjC bridge would look up methods using combined command name + argument labels (current arrangement would require a custom callable that captures target + name, then appends arg labels to name in order to construct full ObjC name); where `get` returns a handler, it would always wrap it as a closure


typealias AttributedValue = Value & Attributed

// TO DO: should get/set take optional 'delegate'? (e.g. in `tell app NAME {â€¦}` block, all names are looked up on app object first, then in parent scope; similarly, when storing values, `set(_:to:)` should delegate directly to tell block's parent scope)

protocol Attributed {
    
    func set(_ key: String, to value: Value) throws // used to set (via `store` command/`IDENTIFIER:VALUE` assignment) [mutable] simple attributes and one-to-one relationships only (for one-to-many relationships, `get` an [all] elements specifier, e.g. `items`, then apply selector to that); TO DO: this needs more thought, as `set(REFERENCE,to:VALUE)` is also used particularly in aelib; it might be that we standardize on `set(_:to:)` for *all* assignment
    
    func get(_ key: String) throws -> Value
    
    func handle(command: Command, commandEnv: Scope, coercion: Coercion) throws -> Value // used to look-up *and* invoke a handler for the specified command (the given arguments are passed along to `Handler.call()`, along with the handlerEnv argument)
    
    // TO DO: introspection
    
}


extension Attributed { // TO DO: currently used by Reference and List, which rely on their own `get()` implementation to return closures each time; implementing `handle` on those will eliminate need for Closures, allowing their selector and other methods to be constructed as unbound primitive handlers

// TO DO: put all user-only metadata (e.g. documentation annotations) in a separate structure/module which is lazily loaded/instantiated only when needed


protocol Scope: Attributed { // TO DO: `Identifier`, `Command` use Environment.find() to retrieve the slot's value AND its lexical scope so that it can eval the value in its original context when coercing it to the requested return type (one option is for `get` to return both, although the scope needs to be protocol based and restricted to read-only [note: a read-only protocol will discourage, but won't prevent, upcasting of a returned Environment; a safer option is to wrap the env in a shim, or maybe ask the env for a read-only version of itself which prevents any fiddling]) //
    
    // TO DO: make sure that value's attributes are fully introspectable (i.e. don't just implement everything as an opaque `switch` block in `get()`, but instead define the value's interface and let the glue generator build the get()/set() implementation automatically; in the case of aelib, interface definitions will be defined dynamically by terminology parser)
